Here are a few copy/paste Snowflake SQL patterns that will give you daily spend across warehouses, while excluding Document AI (both the Snowsight “Document AI” feature and the Cortex document-processing functions like PARSE_DOCUMENT, AI_EXTRACT, <model_build_name>!PREDICT).  ￼

⸻

1) Daily warehouse compute credits (incl. idle) excluding Document AI

This gives you a clean per-warehouse daily view showing:
	•	total compute credits (includes idle),
	•	idle compute credits,
	•	Document AI query execution credits,
	•	“non-Document-AI” query execution credits,
	•	and “non-Document-AI compute including idle”.

-- Tip: if you plan to reconcile with ORG views later, consider UTC:
-- ALTER SESSION SET TIMEZONE = 'UTC';

WITH params AS (
  SELECT DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS start_ts
),

-- All query IDs that are "Document AI"
doc_ai_query_ids AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT query_id
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DOCUMENT_AI_USAGE_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)

  UNION

  SELECT DISTINCT query_id
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_USAGE_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
),

-- Compute credits attributed to Document AI queries (execution only; no idle)
doc_ai_attributed AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', qah.start_time) AS usage_day,
    qah.warehouse_name,
    SUM(COALESCE(qah.credits_attributed_compute, 0)) AS docai_query_exec_credits,
    SUM(COALESCE(qah.credits_used_query_acceleration, 0)) AS docai_qas_credits
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY qah
  WHERE qah.start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
    AND (
      qah.query_id IN (SELECT query_id FROM doc_ai_query_ids)
      OR COALESCE(qah.root_query_id, qah.query_id) IN (SELECT query_id FROM doc_ai_query_ids)
    )
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),

-- Warehouse daily totals
wh_daily AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', start_time) AS usage_day,
    warehouse_name,
    SUM(credits_used_compute) AS total_compute_credits,
    SUM(credits_used_cloud_services) AS total_cloud_services_credits,
    SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits,
    SUM(credits_attributed_compute_queries) AS total_attributed_query_credits
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT
  w.usage_day,
  w.warehouse_name,

  -- Totals
  w.total_compute_credits,
  w.total_attributed_query_credits,
  (w.total_compute_credits - w.total_attributed_query_credits) AS idle_compute_credits,

  -- Doc AI subset (execution only)
  COALESCE(d.docai_query_exec_credits, 0) AS docai_query_exec_credits,

  -- What you asked for: "non Document AI" across warehouses
  (w.total_attributed_query_credits - COALESCE(d.docai_query_exec_credits, 0)) AS non_docai_query_exec_credits,
  (w.total_compute_credits - COALESCE(d.docai_query_exec_credits, 0)) AS non_docai_compute_including_idle_credits,

  -- Useful context
  w.total_cloud_services_credits,
  COALESCE(d.docai_qas_credits, 0) AS docai_qas_credits

FROM wh_daily w
LEFT JOIN doc_ai_attributed d
  ON w.usage_day = d.usage_day
 AND w.warehouse_name = d.warehouse_name
ORDER BY 1, 2;

Why this works:
	•	WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY gives hourly credits used (compute + cloud services) plus credits attributed to queries (so you can compute idle).  ￼
	•	QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY gives per-query compute credits (execution only, not idle), which makes “exclude Document AI queries” feasible.  ￼
	•	Both Document AI views provide the query IDs to exclude.  ￼

Notes:
	•	Warehouse metering credits don’t include the daily cloud-services billing adjustment; billed compute is best reconciled via METERING_DAILY_HISTORY (account-level).  ￼
	•	Latency: warehouse metering can lag hours; query attribution can lag up to ~8 hours.  ￼

⸻

2) Daily AI token credits (Cortex AI Functions) by warehouse excluding Document AI

If by “expenditure on non Document AI processes” you meant AI-services credits (token-based), this uses CORTEX_AISQL_USAGE_HISTORY and removes any query IDs that were document processing. TOKEN_CREDITS explicitly excludes warehouse credits.  ￼

WITH params AS (
  SELECT DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS start_ts
),

doc_ai_query_ids AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT query_id
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DOCUMENT_AI_USAGE_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)

  UNION

  SELECT DISTINCT query_id
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_DOCUMENT_PROCESSING_USAGE_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
),

wh_map AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT warehouse_id::TEXT AS warehouse_id, warehouse_name
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY
  WHERE start_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
    AND warehouse_id IS NOT NULL
    AND warehouse_name IS NOT NULL
),

aisql_non_doc AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', usage_time) AS usage_day,
    warehouse_id,
    SUM(token_credits) AS ai_token_credits,
    SUM(tokens) AS tokens
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CORTEX_AISQL_USAGE_HISTORY
  WHERE usage_time >= (SELECT start_ts FROM params)
    AND query_id NOT IN (SELECT query_id FROM doc_ai_query_ids)
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)

SELECT
  a.usage_day,
  m.warehouse_name,
  a.ai_token_credits,
  a.tokens
FROM aisql_non_doc a
LEFT JOIN wh_map m
  ON a.warehouse_id::TEXT = m.warehouse_id
ORDER BY 1, 2;

Important gotcha: CORTEX_AISQL_USAGE_HISTORY only includes usage on/after Nov 17, 2025.  ￼

⸻

3) Convert credits → currency (if you have ORG usage access)

If you can query SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY, you can compute an effective $/credit for WAREHOUSE_METERING and multiply your per-warehouse credits by it. (This view reports usage date in UTC and can lag up to 72 hours.)  ￼

WITH price_per_credit AS (
  SELECT
    usage_date,
    account_locator,
    SUM(CASE WHEN rating_type='compute'
              AND service_type='WAREHOUSE_METERING'
              AND NOT is_adjustment
             THEN usage_in_currency END)
    /
    NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN rating_type='compute'
                     AND service_type='WAREHOUSE_METERING'
                     AND NOT is_adjustment
                    THEN usage END), 0) AS currency_per_credit,
    MAX(currency) AS currency
  FROM SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE.USAGE_IN_CURRENCY_DAILY
  WHERE usage_date >= DATEADD('day', -30, CURRENT_DATE())
    AND account_locator = CURRENT_ACCOUNT()
  GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT * FROM price_per_credit ORDER BY usage_date;

Then join price_per_credit onto the daily warehouse output from query #1 on date.

⸻

If you tell me which “expenditure” you care about most (warehouse credits, AI token credits, or true billed $), I’ll collapse this into one final query that outputs exactly the daily columns you want.
